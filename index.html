          <h4>Don't be afraid to make mistakes</h4>
          <p>
            Your goal is to deliver a message, not speak perfect English, with the right
            grammar and vocabulary. Even native English speakers make mistakes!

          <h4>Practises Speaking English</h4>
          <p>
            Practice makes perfect. Constantly look for opportunities to test out your 
            spoken English. Busuu's online English classes, for instance, are interactive,
            45-minute group lessons, guided by a professional teacher. They are a great
            way to practise speaking English and learn faster in a fun, safe environment.

            start speaking more fluently and confidently in English conversations, learning 
            how to give your opinions in English with new expressions and idioms..

          <h4>Think in English</h4>
          <p>
            Go from speaking good English to great English by thinking in the language.
            You'll find it difficult at first, but after some time you'll learn how to 
            switch between speaking English and your first language.

          <h4>Talk to yourself</h4>
          <p>
            It will look funny, but by talking to yourself in English in front of the mirror for each day,
            you'll learn to pronounce every letter in the English alphabet, plus when and how to use 
            different expressions. You'll also learn where you make most of the mistakes.

            have, no matter how small, will help you<br>improve your skills over time. Be proud of<br>your progress.
